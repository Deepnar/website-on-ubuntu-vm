#  Learning Web Development

This repository documents my journey as I learn **web development**, starting with the basics of **HTML**. As I progress, I’ll add more technologies like **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and modern frameworks.

---

##  Current Focus: HTML

I’m currently exploring and practicing **HTML**, the foundational language of the web.

### Topics I'm covering:
- Page structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, paragraphs, links
- Images
- Semantic and structural tags

---

##  What's Next

As I move forward in my learning journey, I plan to:
- Add **CSS** to style the HTML pages
- Learn **JavaScript** for interactivity
- Build small projects like a to-do app, calculator, or portfolio site

---

##  Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A place to practice and experiment
- A way to track how far I've come in web development

##  Status

> **Currently learning HTML** — this project will grow as I continue learning new topics and building more features.
